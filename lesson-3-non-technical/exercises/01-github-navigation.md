**Duration**: 10 minutes | **Audience**: Non-technical

## 🎯 Objective

Get comfortable navigating GitHub so you can participate in technical conversations without writing code.

## 🧪 Activity 1: Explore a Repository

1. Open this training repository:
   - `https://github.com/vishaljsoni/copilot-training-workshop`
2. Identify:
   - Repository **name**
   - **Owner** (user or organization)
   - **Description**
   - Last updated time

### Questions to Ask

- What is this repo about?
- Who maintains it?
- How active is it?

---

## 🧪 Activity 2: Understand the File View

On the main page of the repository:

1. Identify:
   - `Code` tab
   - `Issues` tab
   - `Pull requests` tab
   - `Projects` tab (if enabled)
   - `Actions` tab

2. Click on the `Code` tab (if not already there)

### Explore the File Tree

- Click into `lesson-1-getting-started/`
- Then click `README.md`

Notice:
- File content preview
- Breadcrumb navigation at the top
- Icons showing file types

---

## 🧪 Activity 3: View File History

Staying on `lesson-1-getting-started/README.md`:

1. Click the **clock icon** ("History")
2. You will see a list of commits affecting this file.

For each commit, note:
- Author
- Time
- Commit message

### Why This Matters

As a PM or designer, you can:
- See when requirements changed
- Understand when docs were updated
- Identify who to ask about changes

---

## 🧪 Activity 4: Blame View (Who Changed What)

1. On a file (e.g., `README.md`), click the **three dots (...)**
2. Select **"Blame"**

This shows line-by-line:
- Who changed each line
- In which commit
- When

### Use Cases

- Find who wrote a specific requirement
- Track when copy/wording changed
- Understand evolution of documentation

---

## 🧪 Activity 5: Branches (High-Level)

1. At the top left, find the branch dropdown (usually `main`)
2. Click it to see any other branches

Conceptually:
- **Main**: Stable, production-ready
- **Feature branches**: Work in progress

You don't need to manage branches yourself, but knowing they exist helps you understand where work happens.

---

## ✅ Checkpoint

Before moving on, make sure you can:
- [ ] Open a repository and understand the landing page
- [ ] Navigate to files and folders
- [ ] View file history
- [ ] Use blame to see who changed which lines
- [ ] Identify branches at a high level

---

## 💡 Reflection Questions

- How does this compare to tools you already use (Confluence, Google Docs, etc.)?
- Where could GitHub replace or complement your current tools?
