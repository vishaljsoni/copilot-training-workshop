## 🎯 Pro Tips for Non-Developers

1. **Describe Outcomes, Not Code**
   - "Create a PRD template for a new feature" vs "Write JavaScript"

2. **Use Your Language**
   - Plain English is perfect. No need for technical jargon.

3. **Iterate with Copilot**
   - Start with a rough idea
   - Ask Copilot to refine, expand, or simplify

4. **Stay in Context**
   - Open the file or PR you're working on
   - Ask questions like "Summarize this" or "What changed here?"

5. **Review Everything**
   - Copilot accelerates, but **you own the decision**
